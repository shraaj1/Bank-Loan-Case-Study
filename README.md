## Bank Loan Case Study Project - Data Analysis using Excel by Raj Rathod

### Overview
Welcome to the Bank Loan Case Study project repository! This project is aimed at analyzing patterns in loan application data to improve decision-making processes in a finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to ensure that capable applicants are not rejected while minimizing the risk of loan defaults.

### Project Description
Imagine you're a data analyst at a finance company facing the challenge of minimizing loan defaults without rejecting capable applicants. The dataset provided contains information about loan applications categorized into two scenarios: customers with payment difficulties and all other cases. Our goal is to use EDA techniques to understand how customer and loan attributes influence the likelihood of default, aiding in better decision-making processes.

### Business Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Identify patterns indicating difficulty in paying loan instalments.
- Improve decision-making processes, such as loan approval, denial, or adjustment of loan terms.

### Data Analytics Tasks
1. **Handling Missing Data**: Identify missing data and determine appropriate methods for handling them effectively using Excel built-in functions.
   
2. **Detecting Outliers**: Identify and address outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features.
   
3. **Analyzing Data Imbalance**: Assess data imbalance and its impact on analysis accuracy, focusing on binary classification problems.
   
4. **Conducting Various Analyses**: Perform univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analyses to gain insights into factors influencing loan default.

5. **Identifying Correlations**: Identify top correlations between variables and the target variable for different scenarios using Excel functions.
